# Assignment 2

It is due Monday, the 24th of February

## Assignment 2-1 (10 points)

The 'int' type in Java is for integers of some fixed
precision.  More precisely, each integer of the type int is
represented a sequence of bits of some fixed length. Please write a
program that finds this length. Your program is expected return the
correct answer instantly.

## Assignment 2-2 (10 points)

Recursion is a fundamental concept in programming. Quitely
unfortunately, the support for recursion in Java is very limited.
Nontheless, we will be making extensive use of recursion in this
class. This question asks you to give a recursive implementation of
binary search. Please see the given code for more information.

## Assignment 2-3 (30 points)

A deque (double-ended queue) combines a stack and a queue together.
Please give a generic array-based implementation of deque.

## Assignment 2-4 (30 points)

A deque (double-ended queue) combines a stack and a queue together.
Please give a generic list-based implementation of deque. Note the
list here is doubly-linked.

## Assignment 2-5 (20 points)

Let A be a sorted array of N integers.
Please determine whether there exist indices i and j and k satisfying
A[i] + A[j] = A[k].  Design a soft quadratic (that is, $tO(n^2), where
$tQ$ is for the "soft" big O). algorithm for the problem.
