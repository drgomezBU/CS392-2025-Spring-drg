# Assignment 5

It is due Monday, the 14th of April.

Please first study the given code in the Code directory,
which includes "partial" implementations of Heap, HeapSort,
ChainedHashTable, and OpenHashTable. Notice that some of the
interfaces given are in "old" fashion; they are not generic
but they should be. It is a TASK FOR YOU to turn them into
proper generic interfaces. If your submitted implementation
does not make proper use of generic interfaces, then I will
ask you to fix and resubmit.

## Assignment 5-1 (30 points)

Please implement the heap data structure. You can use Heap.java as
your start point.

## Assignment 5-2 (30 points)

Please implement PriorityQueue based on your heap implementation in
Assignment 5-1.

## Assignment 5-3 (30 points)

Please finish ChainedHashTable (hash table using separate
chaining). Note that the give HashTable interface is not generic.
You should first turn it into a generic one: HashTable<K,V>

## Assignment 5-4 (30 points)

Please finish OpenHashTable (hash table with open addressing).
