# Assignment 3

It is due Monday, the 3rd of March

## Assignment 3-1 (10 points)

Please use binary search to find out the maximum
allowed integer argument for a "mysterious" recursive
function.

## Assignment 3-2 (30 points)

Given an implementation for sorting on arrays, how do you check
whether the implementation actually implements stable sorting? This is
probably the most interesting question in this assignment.

Hint: You may want to use System.identityHashCode to identify objects.

## Assignment 3-3 (20 points)

Assign03_03 extends Assign02_03 with support for Iterable2 (containing
a forward iterator and a backward iteractor).

## Assignment 3-4 (20 points)

Assign03_04 extends Assign02_04 with support for Iterable2 (containing
a forward iterator and a backward iteractor).

## Assignment 3-5 (30 points)

Please give a RECURSIVE implementation of insertion sort.
